A message that Argenta understood as no other when they reached out to us for a complete UX audit of their mobile app. Setting off with an ambitious app store score of 4.5, we’ve been asked to challenge them even more to turn UX into their ultimate competitive advantage. And that in only 6 weeks.

* **Solution**: delivering a full-fledged assessment of both Argenta’s current mobile app and future roadmap.
* **Approach**: assessing the current UX of the Argenta mobile app and how they compare to key competitors, combined with analytics research & user interviews.
* **Outcome**: Argenta is ready to fully leverage UX as their main competitive advantage.

## Challenge

When Argenta approached us, they were on a twofold UX quest. Short term: how were their users experiencing the current mobile app? And long term: how would the planned roadmap satisfy the mobile banking needs of the modern digital-savvy user? 

Their goal was to streamline the entire mobile experience and sharpen their future scenario while still complying with the strict set of compliance rules typical for the banking system.

To complement their in-house team of experts, Argenta was looking for that challenging outside-in perspective. And that’s exactly what we put to the table: cross-UX expertise from various sectors. By including these new perspectives, Argenta was able to understand how users more than ever raise the bar for outstanding UX encounters.

## Solution

In the Pocket’s mission for Argenta? Delivering a full UX assessment of its current mobile banking experience, highlighting key UX strengths, improvement areas and gaps. To build a strong foundation for this, we harnessed the insights from both analytics reviews and user testing. 

A comparison with a national and an international key competitor allowed us  to benchmark the UX performance even better and sharpen Argenta’s future plans. 

Finally, to challenge and shape their roadmap, we worked towards design recommendations for the top 10 prio UX improvements. Not losing ourselves in little tweaks and fixes, we delivered full concepts that took both benefits and potential risks or complexities into account. Design mock-ups were made for every recommendation to clearly visualize what it would look like in the app. 

Building on more than a decade of experience, we know what it takes to create a winning UX strategy. That’s why we delivered all of the above in just 6 weeks.
