Sofico specializes in **B2B software solutions for companies providing automotive finance, leasing, fleet, and mobility management services**. They have maintained an **industry leader** position for nearly three decades and operate on a global scale, with offices on four continents.

Their powerful platforms serve as an **administrative backbone**, helping leasing companies to manage their contracts; from car configuration and price quotes in the frontend, to contract management and lease accounting in the back office. Users include both leasing company staff and end users like drivers or fleet managers.

The company wanted to **revamp its front office offering** based on new **cloud services architecture**, and thought a mobile app would be essential for its customers to support its drivers and mobility users. They joined forces with In The Pocket to build an intuitive and comprehensive mobile application that would make its users' lives easier.

>'The product design team from In The Pocket quickly understood what we were after and helped us explore the potential of mobile in our industry. A real eye opener.'

## The result  

The Miles Mobile.Next app is connected to Sofico's Miles software and makes important fleet management and leasing information available to company car drivers on their mobile device. Miles Mobile.Next is a white-label product, which means that leasing companies can offer the tool to their customers and drivers, customized to their own branding, with the functionalities that suit their specific needs.  

The app brings **powerful features** to lease drivers and mobility users:  

* Handy on-the-road features, like finding nearby fuel stations (compliant with your fuel card) and parking, registering professional expenses and trips, etc.
* Reminders for maintenance and tire changes, and being able to directly book an appointment.
* Easy incident (breakdown, accident) reporting with a photo function, including assistance requests and follow-up.
* Communicaton tools to touch base with fleet managers and/or lease company (ranging from support questions, speed tickets, invoices, â€¦).
* Everything related to the lease contract (pre-contractual practicalities, mileage, forecasts, end-of-contract takeover, etc.)
